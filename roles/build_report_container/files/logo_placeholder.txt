# MOI Logo Placeholder

This directory should contain the MOI logo file named `moi_logo.png`.

## To add your actual MOI logo:

1. Replace this placeholder with your actual MOI logo
2. Name it exactly: `moi_logo.png`
3. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: PNG (transparent background preferred)
   - Dimensions: approximately 150px width x 60-80px height
   - File size: Under 500KB

## If you don't have a logo yet:

You can disable the logo display by setting this in your job template extra variables:
```yaml
show_customer_logo: false
```

This will show only the MOI text branding without attempting to load the logo image.
